# LimbDetectionTest-
expirementing on accuracy of horizion detection with different algorithms and lighting

five points: scans down an image vertically performs canny opperation and selects largest edge value. Finds 5ish edge values and graphs on image

simpleEdgeDetection: performs canny sobel and LoG on images in (test_images) folder. This is just for testing and contimplation
